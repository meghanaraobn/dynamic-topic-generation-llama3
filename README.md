# Dynamic Topic Generation using Llama 3
Dynamic topic generation is the process of automatically identifying and categorizing the main themes or subjects within a collection of text data. Unlike traditional methods that rely on predefined categories, dynamic topic generation adapts to the content being analyzed, allowing topics to vary based on the unique characteristics of the texts.

### Why Llama 3?

Llama 3, a Large Language Model (LLM), is chosen for this task due to its robust capabilities in understanding and generating natural language text. Llama 3 can effectively capture the semantic meaning and context from text paragraphs, making it suitable for dynamic topic generation.
